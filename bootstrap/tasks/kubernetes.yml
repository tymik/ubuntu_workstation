# In general instead of using this I prefer to use docker containers
# with kubectl and helm and I advise you to do the same unless you
# really need to install that.
# kubectl: https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kubectl/
# helm: https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/helm
# and I did not test commands below, so they may work or may need some tuning
